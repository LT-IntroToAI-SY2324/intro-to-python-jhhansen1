# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?
 So far I like python for the most part. I like that you dont have to declare variable types and I like that I feel like my code always seems shorter and more concise then in Java. The one thing I dont like is that instead of semicolons the code relys on indentation to format which confuses me.


2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?
Alot of the keywords are similair between python and java like "for", "while", and "return" which I am happy is the same because it makes switching languages much easier. The removal of the use of semicolons has so far been the hardest switch because I dont like how python relies on indentation because I didnt learn to code that way.


3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?
I relearned how to do some of the standard tools in python that I originally learned how to do in java like for loops and creating and running through lists. I also learned some important differences between python and java.
